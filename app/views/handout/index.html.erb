        <h4>About The Iron Yard</h4>

        <p>The Iron Yard teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level
          programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer.
          Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying <%= all_courses('houston').to_sentence %> and
          today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>
